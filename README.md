##### This is a Processing and P5 repo with some of my old projects.
To test them, you just need to clone, and open the index.html file.
It will open in a new tab on your browser.
[P5] is a JavaScript library for drawing. [Processing], on the other hand, is a new object oriented programming language based on Java. They're both created by [Daniel Shiffman]. Check out his videos (or the pages) to know more about the languages.
